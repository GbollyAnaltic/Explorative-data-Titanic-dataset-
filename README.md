# Explorative-data-Titanic-dataset-
I recently completed an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset to uncover insights about the passengers and factors that influenced survival during the disaster. Below are the key findings:

	•	Dataset Overview:
	•	The Titanic dataset consists of information on 891 passengers, including features like age, gender, passenger class (Pclass), fare, number of siblings/spouses aboard (SibSp), number of parents/children aboard (Parch), and the port of embarkation (Embarked).
	•	Key Findings:
	•	Survival Rate: Overall survival rate was approximately 38%.
	•	Gender: Women had a significantly higher survival rate (about 74%) compared to men (about 19%).
	•	Passenger Class: First-class passengers had a higher survival rate (around 63%) compared to second-class (47%) and third-class (24%) passengers.
	•	Age Distribution: The age distribution of passengers showed that children had a higher chance of survival, with many younger passengers surviving the disaster.
	•	Embarkation: Passengers who embarked from Cherbourg (C) had a higher survival rate compared to those from Southampton (S) and Queenstown (Q).
	•	Visualizations:
	•	Survival by Gender: A bar plot showed the stark contrast in survival rates between male and female passengers.
	•	Survival by Class: A stacked bar plot highlighted the higher survival rates of first-class passengers.
	•	Age Distribution: A histogram revealed the age distribution across the dataset, showing more young children in the survivor group.
